# 8-Qubit W State – First Building Block for Martian Ethics Engine

**Date:** 27 November 2025 – Greece  
**Job ID:** `598eb802-0a56-428c-aec0-b23edca61e3c`

This is the first verifiable quantum decision kernel designed to run on **Mars**, inside Martian habitats, lunar bases, and deep-space ships.

When humans live on another planet, robots will have to make life-or-death decisions in seconds, with zero bias and zero communication delay to Earth.

The 8-qubit W state gives us:
- Perfectly equal exploration of 8 critical events simultaneously  
- Classical ethical layer that maps quantum outcomes to moral actions  
- A system that already runs on today’s NISQ hardware and scales to 100+ qubits tomorrow

**Target environments**
- Martian surface habitats  
- Martian underground cities  
- Lunar bases  
- Deep-space transit ships  
- Asteroid mining outposts

The same code that ran on IBM QUBS today will run on the first quantum node on Martian soil.

Humanity becomes multi-planetary only when ethics becomes quantum-native.
