# 8-Qubit W State – First Building Block for Universal Ethical Decision Engine

**Date:** 27 November 2025 – Greece  
**Job ID:** `598eb802-0a56-428c-aec0-b23edca61e3c`

This is the first verifiable quantum decision kernel designed for **humanity on Earth and beyond** – from disaster zones today to Martian habitats tomorrow.

When life-or-death choices must be made in seconds, with zero bias and zero room for error,  
the 8-qubit W state gives us:
- Perfectly equal exploration of 8 critical events simultaneously  
- A classical ethical layer that turns quantum outcomes into moral actions  
- A system that already runs on today’s NISQ hardware and scales to the future

**Target environments**
- Earth: disaster response, hospitals, refugee crises  
- Space: Martian habitats, lunar bases, deep-space missions  

The same code that ran on IBM QUBS today will run on the first quantum node on another planet.

Humanity becomes truly multi-planetary only when ethics becomes quantum-native.
